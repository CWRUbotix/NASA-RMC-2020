motor_command_accel: 30  # (RPM/s) Wheel acceleration limit for path following
target_velocity: 0.15  # (m/s) Path following speed
lambda_e: 0.85 # larger values make robot turn towards path faster
G_u: 3  # Overall robot turning speed multiplier
reference_point_x: 0.5  # (m) x position of point on robot that controller is trying to drive towards the path
turn_speed: 0.4  # (rad/s) speed at which robot turns in place
